.. _diff_filters:

==================
Filtering the diff
==================
All the filters listed in :ref:`filters` can be applied to the diff before it's sent (see below how).

In addition, two filters are custom-made for diff results:

* :ref:`additions_only`
* :ref:`deletions_only`

Finally, if you're using unified diff (default), you can change the number of context lines.

* :ref:`contextlines`

.. _generic_filters:

Standard filters
----------------
See :ref:`here <filters>` for the full list of generic filters.  Below is an example on how you apply a generic filter
to the result from the diff:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.com
   diff_filter:
   - delete_lines_containing: "@@"


.. _additions_only:

additions_only
---------------
The ``additions_only: true`` directive causes the report for that source to contain only lines that are added by the
diff (no deletions). This is extremely useful for monitoring new content on sites where content gets added while old
content "scrolls" away.

Because lines that are modified generate both a deleted and an added line by the diff, this filter always displays
modified lines.

As a safeguard, ``additions_only: true`` will display a warning (and all lines deleted) when the size of the source shrinks
by 75% or more, as this could be due to changes in where or how the information is published (requiring the job to
be reconfigured to continue monitoring the relevant information).

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/#add_only
   additions_only: true

Output:

.. image:: html_diff_filters_example_1.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: HTML reporter example output

or (text):

.. code-block:: none

Note: When using ``additions_only: true``, the key :ref:`contextlines` (the number of context lines) is set to 0; of course,
this can be changed by specifying the key with the desired value in the job.

.. _deletions_only:

deletions_only
--------------
The ``deletions_only: true`` directive causes the report for that source to contain only lines that are deleted by the diff (no
additions).

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/#del_only
   deletions_only: true

Output:

.. _contextlines:

contextlines
------------
The ``contextlines`` directive causes a unified diffs to have a set number of context lines that might be different than
than Python's default of 3 (or as set by the filters above).


Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/#lots_of_contextlines
   contextlines: 5

Output:

.. code-block:: none
